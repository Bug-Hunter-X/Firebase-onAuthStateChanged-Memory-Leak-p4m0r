This example demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  The provided code snippet showcases a memory leak because the `unsubscribe` function, returned by `onAuthStateChanged`, is never called. This results in the listener continuously running, even when it's no longer needed.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks.
